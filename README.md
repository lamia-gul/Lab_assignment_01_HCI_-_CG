Conclusion:
In conclusion, this lab assignment bridges the theoretical foundations of Human-Computer Interaction with the practical application of semantic web development. 
By analyzing safety-critical systems like the Automatic Syringe from Dix Chapter 9 and routine interactions like the Toggle Switch via Norman’s Seven Stages of Action and GOMS, 
we move beyond surface-level design to understand the cognitive load placed on the user.
Specifically, the application of the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) from Chapter 12 provides a quantitative method to predict expert performance, while the "Who Paid?" 
problem highlights the social and memory-based complexities that technology must mediate. Ultimately, adhering to strict semantic HTML and accessibility standards ensures that 
these complex cognitive insights are delivered through a robust, perceivable, and error-free digital interface.
