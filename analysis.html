      <h2>Interface Evaluation: The Automatic Syringe Case</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>Dix HCI Ch. 9</strong>, an interface for an automatic syringe was evaluated. 
        A critical error occurred because of a mismatch in the <strong>Gulf of Evaluation</strong>.
      </p>
      <article class="note-box">
        <h3>The Evaluation Failure</h3>
        <p>
          The system displayed "5.0" for a dose. The user interpreted this as 5.0 units, but the system 
          was actually set to a much higher scale. This lack of feedback led to a potential overdose 
         .
        </p>
        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Interface evaluation must check if the system state is 
        perceived and interpreted correctly by the user.</p>
